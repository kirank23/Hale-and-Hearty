# Hale-and-Hearty

A Multi-Feature Healthcare App for the Elderly.

## Problem Statement

The market for medical assistance apps is rapidly expanding - both for professional use as well as for patient-centric solutions. There are numerous medical applications but very few of these are providing relevant assistance. “Hale and Hearty” is a cross-platform application which aims at improving the current technology prevalent in the health care sector. 

### The Solution

"Hale and Hearty" improvises the current solutions by integrating some of the most required features in a single application. Features such as 'Tracking daily water intake', 'Timely reminders for medicines', 'Health training programs', 'Calorie specific meal plans' and 'Relevant information about nearby Nutritionists and Health Centers' are present in this app. 

Providing an easy to use interface with multiple features helps improve User Experience and this is what most of the apps lack these days. This is very important for people with recurring symptoms as it helps gain the users trust and helps them recover faster.
